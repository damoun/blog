Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Damien PlÃ©nard, a Site Reliability Engineer currently spearheading transformative initiatives at Mollie in Amsterdam, Netherlands. With over a decade of experience in the tech realm, I specialize in orchestrating seamless transitions from on-premise infrastructure to the cloud, particularly driving the migration to Google Cloud Platform.

In my current role at Mollie, I take pride in owning the On-Premises infrastructure, ensuring its efficiency, and automating server onboarding and maintenance using Ansible. I'm deeply involved in the migration process, employing tools like Terraform and Helm, and implementing Service Level Objective (SLO) frameworks for enhanced performance.

Prior to Mollie, I made significant contributions as a Site Reliability Engineer at Veepee, where I delivered observability solutions for the platform domain. My responsibilities included maintaining Elasticsearch clusters, implementing SaaS platforms for monitoring using Nomad and Docker, and enhancing incident management workflows through automation.

Before my time at Veepee, I honed my skills as a Unix System Engineer at Payplug, focusing on maintaining and developing carrier billing projects. I also had the opportunity to serve as a Teaching Assistant at EPITECH, where I shared my knowledge and passion for computer engineering with aspiring minds.

In terms of education, I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from EPITECH, and I pursued Software Engineering Technology at Beijing Jiaotong University.

Beyond the tech realm, I'm a multifaceted individual. As a gamer and Twitch streamer with a 2000-strong following, I share my gaming experiences four times a week. Away from the screen, I'm a proud dad, plant enthusiast, and avid learner. I'm also engaged in home renovation projects and contribute as a technical advisor to my house owner association.

Let's connect and explore the possibilities of technology and beyond! ðŸš€âœ¨
